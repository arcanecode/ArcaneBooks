I have a long series of blog posts on PowerShell, you'll find them listed at my [Fun With PowerShell Roundup](https://arcanecode.com/2022/04/04/the-fun-with-powershell-roundup/)

If you want to take a deeper dive into PowerShell, I have many PowerShell courses at Pluralsight, you'll find them listed on my [About Me](https://arcanecode.com/info/) page.

One course that may be especially helpful is my Pluralsight course [PowerShell 7 Quick Start for Developers on Linux, macOS and Windows](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/jWzbre), as it dives into the creation of functions, modules, and more.

If you don't have a Pluralsight subscription, just go to [my list of courses on Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/kjz6jn) . At the top is a Try For Free button you can use to get a free 10 day subscription to Pluralsight, with which you can watch my courses, or any other course on the site.
