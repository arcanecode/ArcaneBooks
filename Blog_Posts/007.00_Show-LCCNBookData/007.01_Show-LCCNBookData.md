# Fun With PowerShell - Showing Book Data at the Library of Congress with Start-Process

In my previous post, [Fun With PowerShell – Opening Websites with Start-Process](https://arcanecode.com/2023/05/22/fun-with-powershell-opening-websites-with-start-process/), I showed how to use the `Start-Process` cmdlet to open a website. This is part of my ongong [ArcaneBooks Project](https://arcanecode.com/2023/03/13/the-arcanebooks-project-an-introduction/), in which I created a new function to display the webpage for a book at the OpenLibrary website by using the ISBN.

I wanted to create a similar function to work with the Library of Congress website, and so let me present the `Show-LCCNBookData` function.

## Show-LCCNBookData

The function I created, `Show-LCCNBookData` is almost identical to the `Show-ISBNBookData` function I covered in the [previous post](https://arcanecode.com/2023/05/22/fun-with-powershell-opening-websites-with-start-process/), so I won't go into a lot of depth in this post.

As with the ISBN version, I made this an advanced function so users could pipe data into it.

``` powershell
function Show-LCCNBookData
{
  [CmdletBinding(HelpURI="https://github.com/arcanecode/ArcaneBooks/blob/1ebe781951f1a7fdf19bb6731487a74fa12ad08b/ArcaneBooks/Help/Get-ISBNBookData.md")]
  [alias("slccn")]
  param (
         [Parameter( Mandatory = $true,
                     ValueFromPipeline = $true,
                     HelpMessage = 'Please enter the LCCN (Library of Congress Control Number).'
                     )]
         [string] $LCCN
        )
```

Note I still need to update the help URL to the correct one, but the rest of the function opening is complete, with the sole parameter being the `$LCCN`.

Now we fall into the process block.

``` powershell
  process
  {
    foreach($number in $LCCN)
    {
      Write-Verbose "Beginning Show-LCCNBookData for $ISBN at $(Get-Date).ToString('yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss tt')"

      $lccnCleaned = $LCCN.Replace('-', '').Replace(' ', '')
      $lccnPrefix = $lccnCleaned.Substring(0,2)
      $lccnPadded = $lccnCleaned.Substring(2).PadLeft(6, '0')

      # Now combine the reformatted LCCN and save it as a property
      $lccnFormatted ="$($lccnPrefix)$($lccnPadded)"

      $baseURL = "https://lccn.loc.gov/"

      $url = "$($baseURL)$($lccnFormatted)"

      Write-Verbose 'Opening the Book on Library of Congress Number'

      Start-Process $url

      Write-Verbose "Finished Getting Data for $($LCCN)"
    }

    Write-Verbose "Done opening the web pages at Library of Congress"

  }
```

When we fall into the process loop we first need to clean up the LCCN that was passed in. As was documented in my [LCCN overview post](https://arcanecode.com/2023/04/10/arcanebooks-library-of-congress-control-number-lccn-an-overview/) the LCCN is the two digit year at front, then six digits. If the number of digits after the first two isn't six in length we have to zero pad it to become six, which will make the entire LCCN string eight digits.

We then append the formatted LCCN to the base URL for the LOC website. Then we use the `Start-Process` cmdlet to open the webpage.

## Calling Show-LCCNBookData

Calling the function is pretty easy, you can either pass in a Library of Congress Control Number as a parameter or via the pipeline. All these examples should open the Library of Congress website, in your default browser, with the book associated with the LCCN you passed in.

``` powershell
# Pass in a single LCCN as a parameter
$LCCN = '54009698'
Show-LCCNBookData -LCCN $LCCN -Verbose

# Alias
$LCCN = '54009698'
slccn -LCCN $LCCN -Verbose

# Pipe in a single ISBN
$LCCN = '54-9698'
$LCCN | Show-LCCNBookData

.EXAMPLE
# Pipe in an array of LCCNs
$LCCNs = @( '54-9698'
          , '40-33904'
          , '41-3345'
          , '64-20875'
          , '74-75450'
          , '76-190590'
          , '71-120473'
          )
$LCCNs | Show-LCCNBookData -Verbose
```

In the final example we can actually pipe in an array of LCCNs, it should open up a page for each one.

Note the Library of Congress isn't perfect, sometimes it will bring up a page with multiple items for the number passed in as it may have multiple entries. It's still faster though than having to do manual searches on the LoC website.

## Conclusion

This post and the previous one demonstrates how easy it can be to create helper functions for your modules. My two show functions are designed to let users quickly bring up the webpage for the books they are working with.
