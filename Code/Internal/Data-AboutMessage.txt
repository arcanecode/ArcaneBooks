This module is designed to retrieve metadata for books based on either the ISBN
or the LCCN (Library of Congress Catalog Number). It will return data such as
the book title, author, and more.

To see a list of functions, please use the "Show-AboutFunctions" cmdlet of the class.

Each cmdlet has help, you can use the Get-Help feature of PowerShell to learn more about each one.
